# Text Case Converter

This Java/Kotlin library provides an intuitive API for converting strings between different text cases. It has a wide range of built-in support for the most common text cases. In addition, the library is designed to be easily extended with new custom text cases, making it highly flexible and adaptable.

> ℹ️ In this repository, changes don't happen that often and the library gets updated very rarely. However, this is **not** an abandoned project. Since the code is relatively simple and has good test coverage, there is hardly any need to change anything.

## Dependencies

This library is available at [Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/dev.turingcomplete/text-case-converter). It consists of a main library and an optional one that provides extensions for Kotlin.

## General Concept

The foundation of this library are two interfaces:

- A single text case is represented by the interface `dev.turingcomplete.textcaseconverter.TextCase`. It provides meta information (e.g., `title()` and `example()`) and, through several variations of `convert*()` methods, the ability to convert a text to or from that text case.
- The interface `dev.turingcomplete.textcaseconverter.WordsSplitter` which defines an utility that splits a text into a list of words. 

Generally, we must understand that a text case converter works on a list of words, not on raw text. This is because each text case puts the words of a text together in a different way. However, in a raw text it is not machine-visible where a word starts and ends without an additional `WordsSplitter`. For example, in `foo bar baz` the start/end would be defined by a space, but in `fooBarBaz` it would be defined by the case change.

The library has several built-in implementations of both interfaces in the classes `StandardTextCases` and `StandardWordsSplitters` to cover the most common text cases and ways of splitting a text into words (see next chapters).

## Built-in Text Cases

The class `dev.turingcomplete.textcaseconverter.StandardTextCases` contains static instances for the most common text cases:

| Alternating Case     | aLtErNaTiNg CaSe     | Each subsequent character will have the opposite case of the previous character. The alternation starts with the opposite of the first character. |

### Example Usage

The following example shows the usage of the `convert*()` methods of the `TextCase` interface for the built-in Camel Case implementation:

```kotlin
// All will return `fooBarBaz`

// Array of words
StandardTextCases.CAMEL_CASE.convert("foo", "bar", "baz")
// List of words
StandardTextCases.CAMEL_CASE.convert(List.of("foo", "bar", "baz"))
// Given a raw text in which the start/end of a word is defined by a space
StandardTextCases.CAMEL_CASE.convert("Foo bar baz", StandardWordsSplitters.SPACE)

// Given a raw text that is in Cobol Case and convert it into Camel Case
StandardTextCases.CAMEL_CASE.convertForm(StandardTextCases.COBOL_CASE, "FOO-BAR-BAZ")
// Identical to the previous one, only the other way around
StandardTextCases.COBOL_CASE.convertTo(StandardTextCases.CAMEL_CASE, "FOO-BAR-BAZ")
```

## Built-In Words Splitters

The class `dev.turingcomplete.textcaseconverter.StandardWordsSplitters` provides static instances for the most common ways to split a text into words:

- By spaces (` `), that splits a text around (possible multiple) space characters. Blank words are omitted.
- By a single dash (`-`). Blank words are omitted.
- By a single underscore (`_`). Blank words are omitted.
- By a "strict" upper case character, there each upper case character determines a new word. For example `fooBar` would be the two words `foo` and `Bar`, and `SQL` would be the three words `S`, `Q` and `L`.
- By a "soft" upper case character, there each upper case character determines a new word if the previous one wasn't an upper case character. For example `fooBar` would be the two words `foo` and `Bar`, and `SQL` would be the one word.

Note that each `TextCase` provides a `WordsSplitter` through `TextCase#wordsSplitter`, which can be used to split a text given in that text case into individual words. This is used internally, for example, when we want to convert a text case to another without having to explicitly specify a `WordsSplitter`.

## Kotlin Extension

By adding library `test-case-converter-kotlin-extension`, some Kotlin extensions are provided, making it easier to use this library in Kotlin code. These additional features can be seen in the following example:

```kotlin
// Convert the given raw text into Snake Case. Both will return `foo_bar`.
"foo bar".toTextCase(SNAKE_CASE)
"fooBar".toTextCase(SNAKE_CASE, UPPER_CASE)

// Will create a `WordsSplitter` that splits words by the delimiter `//`.
"//".toWordsSplitter()
```

## Locale Handling

Some built-in text cases and words splitters use `String#toLowerCase()` or `String#toUpperCase()`. The output of both methods is locale sensitive. All calls to these methods in this library will use the `Locale` set in the static fields of the `dev.turingcomplete.textcaseconverter.Configuration` class. By default the `Locale.ROOT` is used.
